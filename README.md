# Rock-VS-Mine-Prediction-submarine
In this project, we use the logistic regression algorithm, a supervised machine learning technique, to develop a model capable of predicting the presence of rocks or mines in the marine environment. The model was trained using a sonar dataset of 208 samples, imported from the Kaggle platform.

The aim of the model is to enable naval submarines to identify natural obstacles or sea mines efficiently and accurately. Although the prediction accuracy was not perfect, the results were good, showing the great potential of machine learning techniques in improving safety and efficiency in maritime navigation.
